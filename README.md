This is the code for my Técnicas Algorítmicas class coursework. We were tasked with implementing both a backtracking and heuristic approach to optimize the dispersion of veterinary clinics in the city of Buenos Aires. Given a combination of clinics, we sought to maximize the distance between each pair. The heuristic approach ordered the clinics in ascending order by cost and chose each iteration, while the budget had not been surpassed, the clinic with the lowest cost available.
